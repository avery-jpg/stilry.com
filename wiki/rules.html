### Advertising

I know it may sound unfair, but think about this: you’re a small streamer and someone chats their stream link and people leave your stream. That means you’re streaming to close to nobody or nobody.

### Rude

It’s simple, just don’t be rude. If you do you’ll risk being banned from watching my streams and videos.

### Mod Disobeying

Short and simple; don’t disobey the mods as they have permission to, also, ban you from my channel(s) based on your actions.

### Swearing

Swearing is allowed, but not to or about people. An example is if you’re saying something like “S*it dude that was amazing!” but ***never*** something like “F*ck you” (to someone).

Me personally won’t swear so I can stay kid-friendly.

### Links

Do not post links unless given permission to by a mod. Any links that are made by/accepted by me are also allowed, of course.

### Discriminatory Remarks

Don’t say ***any*** form of racist, homophobic, transphobic, sexist, or anything in that category.

### Leaking

This is pretty obvious. Don’t leak anyone’s private photos, links, phone numbers, emails, addresses, or anything you wouldn’t want to share.

### Judgement

For any rules not listed here, use your knowledge I know you have. Of course, you can ask if so and so is against the rules or not and give an example ***if asked***, without getting punished.

### Inappropriate Discussions

You ***are not*** allowed to engage in inappropriate discussions such as genitalia (specific body parts), or anything to do with intimacy.

### Pinging

Do not mass ping people in the (Twitch) chat, and for YouTube if they ever have that.

### Impersonation

Do not impersonate viewers, mods, or any streamers, popular or not.

### Threatening
Easy enough, don’t threaten people. Doesn’t matter what, just don’t.

### Administrative Decisions
Any administrative decisions are final and cannot be argued against.

### Raiding
You are allowed to raid my live streams, as long as nobody breaks any rule.

### Appealing
Me and/or my mods will get to your appeal as soon as possible, don’t spam in chat to have me/the mods to look at your appeal or your appeal will be declined.

### Spamming
You are not allowed to spam unless, <b>unless</b> I say you can. This goes with mods too.
