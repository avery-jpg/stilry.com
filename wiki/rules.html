<h3 class="text">Advertising</h3>
I know it may sound unfair, but think about this: you‚Äôre a small streamer and someone chats their stream link and people leave your stream. That means you‚Äôre streaming to close to nobody or nobody.

<h3 class="text">Being rude</h3>

It‚Äôs simple, just don‚Äôt be rude. If you do you‚Äôll risk being banned from watching my streams and videos.

<h3 class="text">Mod Disobeying</h3>

Short and simple; don‚Äôt disobey the mods as they have permission to, also, ban you from my channel(s) based on your actions.

<h3 class="text">Swearing</h3>

Swearing is allowed, but not to or about people. An example is if you‚Äôre saying something like ‚ÄúS*it dude that was amazing!‚Äù but ***never*** something like ‚ÄúF*ck you‚Äù (to someone).

Me personally won‚Äôt swear so I can stay kid-friendly.

<h3 class="text">Links</h3>

Do not post links unless given permission to by a mod. Any links that are made by/accepted by me are also allowed, of course.

<h3 class="text">Discriminatory Remarks</h3>

Don‚Äôt say ***any*** form of racist, homophobic, transphobic, sexist, or anything in that category.

<h3 class="text">Leaking</h3>

This is pretty obvious. Don‚Äôt leak anyone‚Äôs private photos, links, phone numbers, emails, addresses, or anything you wouldn‚Äôt want to share.

### Judgement

For any rules not listed here, use your knowledge I know you have. Of course, you can ask if so and so is against the rules or not and give an example ***if asked***, without getting punished.

### Inappropriate Discussions

You ***are not*** allowed to engage in inappropriate discussions such as genitalia (specific body parts), or anything to do with intimacy.

### Pinging

Do not mass ping people in the (Twitch) chat, and for YouTube if they ever have that.

### Impersonation

Do not impersonate viewers, mods, or any streamers, popular or not.

### Threatening
Easy enough, don‚Äôt threaten people. Doesn‚Äôt matter what, just don‚Äôt.

### Administrative Decisions
Any administrative decisions are final and cannot be argued against.

### Raiding
You are allowed to raid my live streams, as long as nobody breaks any rule.

### Appealing
Me and/or my mods will get to your appeal as soon as possible, don‚Äôt spam in chat to have me/the mods to look at your appeal or your appeal will be declined.

### Spamming
You are not allowed to spam unless, <b>unless</b> I say you can. This goes with mods too.
