    If you are here you are probably wanting to host a website, and I am here to help you with that. I have a few suggestions on both free and paid hosting sites.
   
Free (with watermarks):
Weebly
Wix (for people who don't like coding)
Google Firebase (doesn't have a watermark, it just shows (your domain).web.app or (your domain).firebase.app, but is harder to host)
Wordpress
HyperPHP
000webhost
Netlify (recommended for beginners who want to code their own site and have a free SSL. Provides a free *.netlify.app domain, but you can (for free) connect your own.)

All of these have website design tools, and Firebase even has the power to make an app, although you need to pay a fee for apps. If you want to know, posting apps to iOS is $99/year, and Android is a one-time payment of $25. 
    In conclusion, there are many free website-hosting websites. If you are wanting to make an app and don’t care about the price, I recommend Android as it’s only a $25 one-time payment for a developer account. Otherwise, if you literally don't care, I recommend getting both iOS and Android because then you can get more downloads for your app.
    Anyway, thanks for reading and I hope you have a great day!
